# 🧱 ASCII Architectures

A curated collection of **ASCII diagrams** representing the **internal architecture** of tools, frameworks, and systems — for developers, architects, and learners who love structure and clarity.

> 💡 Text-based diagrams to understand systems from the terminal, code editors, or GitHub itself.
